Thanks for dropping by! Let’s embark on this journey through the cyber galaxy together. 🌠

Why Cybersecurity? 🔐
======
Why cybersecurity, you ask? Let me take you on a detour through my past – it's not your everyday cyber tale.

My tech journey started with the humble beginnings of being the go-to "IT support" for my family, fueled by childhood memories of watching my Dad use MS-DOS and playing PC games on CD-ROM. Little did I know, those early days of troubleshooting and gaming laid the groundwork for a deep-seated love for all things tech.

Fast forward a bit, and there I was, post-Air Force, where I'd worked as a linguist, unexpectedly diving headfirst into the world of small business tech transformation. Picture this: a mom-and-pop shop with over 30 years under its belt, still using a shoebox of index cards for customer information. Enter me, armed with a "work smarter, not harder" ethos, transforming that shoebox into a sleek, efficient customer relationship management system on Excel. This was my first real foray into the tech world – self-taught conditional formatting, pivot tables, slicers, and the whole nine yards.

The itch to keep innovating led me to transition the business to cloud-based solutions. QuickBooks desktop? Swapped for QuickBooks online. An old-school office phone system? Replaced with a VoIP setup. And that was just the tip of the iceberg. Email systems, document management, and collaboration tools followed, each move aimed at freeing us from the confines of a physical office and embracing the flexibility of working remotely.

But then came the challenge that changed everything: at home, my laptop could no longer handle the workload. Solution? Build my own computer. Not just any computer, but a custom-built powerhouse that became the heart of my tech explorations. This deep dive into hardware was thrilling, but it was just the appetizer.

My quest for faster internet speeds introduced me to networking, where I upgraded my home setup to a mesh system, ensuring seamless connectivity across the board. Then, Python entered my life, thanks to "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart. It was like finding the missing piece of my tech puzzle, unlocking a newfound passion for programming.

This journey, from family helpdesk support to tech innovator, led me to VETTEC and Fullstack Academy's Cybersecurity Analytics bootcamp. Immersed in the world of cybersecurity, it was here that everything clicked. I'd found my calling.

**So, why cybersecurity? Because it's the culmination of a life spent embracing and conquering tech challenges. It's about taking that innate curiosity that had me playing PC games and turning it into a force for good. Cybersecurity isn't just a career path for me; it's the next chapter in a lifelong adventure in tech. And trust me, this is one adventure that's only just begun.**
